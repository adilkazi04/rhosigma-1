                                        <li>Access points: Industrial Wi-Fi networks consist of access points (APs) that are strategically placed throughout the facility. These APs act as wireless transmitters and receivers, allowing wireless devices to communicate with each other and with the wired network.</li>
                                        <li>Radio frequency (RF) signals: Industrial Wi-Fi uses RF signals to transmit data between devices. RF signals are transmitted over a specific frequency range and are divided into channels to prevent interference with other devices.</li>
                                        <li>Wireless devices: Industrial Wi-Fi networks support a wide range of wireless devices, including laptops, smartphones, tablets, and industrial equipment such as barcode scanners and RFID readers.</li>
                                        <li>Network infrastructure: Industrial Wi-Fi networks require a robust network infrastructure to support the wireless devices and to ensure reliable connectivity. This infrastructure includes switches, routers, firewalls, and other network equipment.</li>
                                        <li>Security: Industrial Wi-Fi networks must be secure to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to protect against cyber threats. This includes implementing strong encryption, authentication, and access control measures.</li>
